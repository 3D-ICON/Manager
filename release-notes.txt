On windows it creates a shell association with StSkin file format (currently unused by anything). Adds icon to StSkin files. 

Opening a StSkin file with the app launches the installation sequence automatically; compiles the skin, applies the skin and restarts Steam.

Does not run in the background or as a daemon.
